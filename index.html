                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Glenn Soriano. I am from the Philippines, but my family immigrated to Canada in 2010. I am married to my wife Yen and have two wonderful boys named Aiath (10) and Aizen (4). I live in Winnipeg, MB Canada. I was born in the church. I work full-time for BELL as a Senior Business Collection Specialist. I love playing table tennis with my son Aiath and love travelling with my family once a year. My family loves the Lord and we show it through serving other people. I am excited and looking forward to get a degree through the inspired BYU pathway connect program. I am currently taking web development to get my first certificate for Software    Development program.</p>
